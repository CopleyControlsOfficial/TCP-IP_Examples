# TCP-IP_Examples
Webpages can be loaded into Copley Ethernet drives to command motion via TCP/IP. Example webpages can be found here. 
A network of Ethernet drives can be controlled via TCP/IP from any browser capable device.

The drive must be an EtherCAT drive converted to Ethernet.
- See this instructional video for how to convert from EtherCAT to Ethernet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8Xfzh-wjlU&t=1s

WARNING: DO NOT view the webpage on multiple browsers at once. The drives' servers can only communicate
with one master (browser) at a time.
